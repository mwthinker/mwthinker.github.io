My name is Marcus Welander and I work as a programmer and my github alias is mwthinker.

This blog's primary function is to help myself to remember useful code and 
commands in my code develpment. It may or maynot be usefull for other people.
The content will be a lot about hybrid app development in javascript and html, but maybe other
technologies will be mentioned.
